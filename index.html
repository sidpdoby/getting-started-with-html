      <li><a href="#lesson-1-1">How the Web Works</a>
        <P>The web serves as a collection of documents with many pieces.</P>
        <p> There are approximately 30 billion pages and hyperlinks are throughout. A variety of document types and hyperlinks included within HTML.  <br>
              These include:
                <ul>
                  <li>Plain Text</li>
                  <li>WORD docs</li>
                  <li>Images</li>
                  <li>Video</li>
                  <li>Music</li>
                </ul>
        </p> 
      <li><a href="#lesson-1-2">HTML</a> HyperText Markup Language
        <p>HTML is the heart of the WEB and is composed of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li> Text, which is the content (what you see).</li>
            <li> Markup, what the content looks like.</li>
            <li> Referenes to other documents, i.e. images and videos.</li>
            <li> Link to oter pages.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>URLS which provide references to documentss</li>
            <li>HTTP, the protocol of the web or the transport medium </li>
            <li>Web applications</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

      <li><a href="#lesson-1-3">Tags and Elements</a>
        <p> Tags are primarily composed of opening and closing tags. However, there are tags called 'void' which do not require a closing tag. </p>
        <p>Failing to properly close a tag may result in everything following the opening tag to assume that attribute of that tag.  <b>For example</b>, 
        if one were to use an opening tag of "em" and fail to close that tag, everything from the opening tag forward would be shown in italics.</p>
        <p> Sample tags include:
          <ul>
            <li> b, for <b>bolding</b> text between opening and closing tags</li>
            <li> em, for <em>italicizing</em> text</li>
            <li> br, creates a break between text.</li>
            <li> p, paragraph, does just that.  LOL.  It has content.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Attributes are properties of HTML and used properly, create powerful pages. <br>Attributes include:</p>
           <ul>
             <li>HREF, which creates a link to access additional information/site.  For example: <a href="www.udacity.con">Udacity</a></li>
             <li>IMG, which does not contain a closing tag. It is considered a "void" tag. In the example below the use of 'alt' creates an alternate view of the referenced source.  This is quite helpful should a web error occur and supports a blind computer user.' <br>
                <b>For example:</b> <img src="URL" alt=text"</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Anchor tags use the "href" attribute while image tags use the "src" attribute.</p>
      </li>
      <li><a href="#lesson-1-4">Why Computers are Stupid</a>
        <p> Computers have yet to reach a full state of articial intelligence and currently posess the proberties applied by a programmer.</p>
     </li>
     <li><a href="#lesson-1-5">Inline vs Block Elements</a>
      <p>Inline elements include:
            <ul>
              <li>a, used to create links such as <a href="reddit.com">derp</a>  Opening and closing tags used.</li>
              <li>br, used toens a line and subsequently wraps text to next line. No closing tag. </li>
              <li>em, emphasizes and italicizes words. Opening and closing tags used.</li>
              <li> img, introduces a picture. No closing tag</li>
              <li> span, uses opening and closing tags</li>
              <li> strong, uses opening and closing tags</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Block elemeents include:
            <ul>
              <li>p, which creates in invisible "block" around everything included within opening and closing tags. Additional attributes such as <br>
              height and width may also be applied.</li>
              <li> form and its closing tags where developer is creating a form for a user to complete. </li>
              <p>Addtionally these block elements may be considered 'container' elements and have content. 
                <ul>
                  <li>div and its closing tag. Syntax::<div class=”bar”>text</div> </li>
                  <li>span and its closing tag. Syntax: <span class =”foo”>text</span> , where ‘class’ is a CSS style</li>     
                </ul>
            </ul>
          </p>

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><a href="#lesson-1-6">Structure of an HTML Document</a>
        <p>The basic structure contans the document type, a header with a title, and the body where the <br>
        content is displayed.  It is important to remember to match all required opening and closing tags.</p>
